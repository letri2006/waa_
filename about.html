								<h4>MADE TOGETHER</h4>
<p>Our pieces are made in Vietnam, where we work closely with a small circle of artisans and workshops who have been with us since the very beginning. Production, for us, is not just a step in the process; it’s a relationship. One built over time through shared values, mutual respect, and a deep appreciation for the hands behind the work.</p>
<p>The artisans we work with come from traditional backgrounds, with skilled hands and years of experience, but they’ve never stopped being open to trying something new. As a young brand full of ideas, working with them has been a creative exchange. We’ve learned so much from their craft, and in return, we bring a fresh perspective that adds new energy to their work.</p>
<p>Each product is carefully considered, crafted to fit naturally into everyday life and be something that can be relied upon over time. It’s not just about making products; it’s about growing together, challenging each other, and finding new ways to build on what we both know.</p>
